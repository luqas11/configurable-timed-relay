### What is this

This project is the firmware, circuit, and case design for a **system to power AC electric appliances daily on a specified hour for a specified amount of time**. The user can specify the time and duration of the connection though a webpage served with an **ESP8266** based board, which is synchronized with the current hour over internet and activates a relay at the required time to power the output. A 3D printed case allows a compact mounting of the involved components and wiring, along with lights to visually indicate the system state.
